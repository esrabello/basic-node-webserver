### This is a mini webserver exercise for Node.JS personal practice.  It loads a static HTML page with few CSS code. There are two links that return a JSON stringfied document.

To run this webserver take the following steps:

1. Go to directory 'webserver/script' in your terminal window.
2. Run 'node webserver.js' and the following message will be prompted: 'Server running at http://localhost:3000'.
3. Open any browser and go to (http://localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000] and a webpage will be loaded.
4. If you click on "Books" or "Authors" a JSON strinfied document will open.
5. Press RETURN to go back to homepage.
